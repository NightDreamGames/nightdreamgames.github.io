              Pirotte Damien built the Escape app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Pirotte Damien at no cost
              and is intended for use as is.

            <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
              For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally
              identifiable information, including but not limited to Nothing. The information that I request will be

            <p>
              I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and
              information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include
              information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version,
              the
              configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and

            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
              Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
              These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal
              memory.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and
              libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to
              either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose
              to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.
              <br></br>

            <h3>Service Providers</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
              I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
              <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
              <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
              <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information.
              The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
              disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
              <br></br>
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
              I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
              acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or
              method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
              <br></br>

            <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
              This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to
              that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to
              review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the
              content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

            <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
              These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally
              identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided
              me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
              and you are aware that your child has provided personal information, please contact me so that I will be
              able to do necessary actions.

            <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
              I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically
              for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
            </p>
            <p>
              This policy is effective as of 2020-12-01

            <h3 class="mb-3 text-black font-weight-bold" font-weight: 500>Terms & Conditions</h3>
            <p class="mb-5"></p>
            <p>
              By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
              therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the
              app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the
              source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make
              derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other
              intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Pirotte Damien.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pirotte Damien is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that
              reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for
              any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you
              exactly what you’re paying for.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Escape app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my
              Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend
              that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and
              limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable
              to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that
              the Escape app won’t work properly or at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app :
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play
                  Services</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/terms-of-service" target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer">Unity</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You should be aware that there are certain things that Pirotte Damien will not take responsibility for.
              Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection
              can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Pirotte Damien cannot take responsibility
              for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of
              your data allowance left.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
              agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
              mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other
              third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including
              roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without
              turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app,
              please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along the same lines, Pirotte Damien cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e.
              You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on
              to avail the Service, Pirotte Damien cannot accept responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              With respect to Pirotte Damien’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s
              important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all
              times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you.
              Pirotte Damien accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
              relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
            </p>
            <p>
              At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements
              for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
              and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Pirotte Damien does not promise
              that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version
              that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application
              when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time
              without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
              rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if
              needed) delete it from your device.
