									<h2 class="text-black font-weight-bold mb-4">Terms & Conditions</h2>
								</div>

								<h5>
									These terms and conditions apply to the Graded app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile
									devices that was created by NightDream Games (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open
									Source service.

									Application remain the property of the Service Provider.

									order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and
									access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your
									phone, which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating
									system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs,
									compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the Application not functioning correctly
									or at all.
								</h5>

									Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used

									assume that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.

									Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the application.
									For instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device
									runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held
									responsible.
								</h5>

								<h5>
									The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently
									available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide
									to extend the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to download the
									updates if you want to continue using the application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it
									will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular
									operating system version installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the
									application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application
									and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you. Unless they inform
									you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will
									end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.
								</h5>

								<h3>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h3>

								<h5>
									The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as
									possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at
									any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or
									its services will be clearly communicated to you.
								</h5>
								<h5>
									The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in
									order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and
									access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting your
									phone, which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating
									system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs,
									compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the Application not functioning correctly
									or at all.
								</h5>
								<h5>
									Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and
									Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used
									by the Application:

								<ul>
									<li>
										<a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
											>Google Play Services</a
										>
									</li>

								<h5>
									Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some
									functions of the Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by
									your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does
									not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data
									allowance.
								</h5>
								<h5>
									If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network
									provider's agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider
									for data usage during the connection to the application, or other third-party charges. By using the
									application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use
									the application outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data
									roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the application, they
									assume that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.
								</h5>
								<h5>
									Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the application.
									For instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device
									runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held
									responsible.
								</h5>
								<h5>
									In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the application, it is important to
									note that while they strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on
									third parties to provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service
									Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of
									relying entirely on this functionality of the application.
								</h5>
								<h5>
									The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently
									available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide
									to extend the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to download the
									updates if you want to continue using the application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it
									will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular
									operating system version installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the
									application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application
									and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you. Unless they inform
									you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will
									end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.
								</h5>

								<h3>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h3>
								<h5>
									The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to
									review this page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by
									posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.
								</h5>
								<h5 class="font-italic">These terms and conditions are effective as of 2024-07-21</h5>
